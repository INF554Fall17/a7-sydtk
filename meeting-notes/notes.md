# INF 554 project idea

## Global energy statistic
The data is from BP company and contains all energy type from 1950 to 2016. 
Here is the statistic resource:
http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.html

Also, it could combine the data to the country’s population in order to find how much energy each person consumes.
About the country’s population, we could look at the UNdata.org
http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=population&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a12
