# INF 554 project idea

## Global energy statistic
The data is from BP company and contains all energy type from 1950 to 2016. 
Here is the statistic resource:
http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.html

Also, it could combine the data to the country’s population in order to find how much energy each person consumes.
About the country’s population, we could look at the UNdata.org
http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=population&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a12

***

Preparation before next discussion (09/23)

1. collect related index datasets (on UNdata?)
2. brain strom: what data attributes/ visualizations are suitable for us.

### Note on 09.24 Discussion Summary

#### Parts still up in the air:
1. How to present comparison among countrues(facet? visualization?)
2. How to present the interaction between energy consumption and other indices.
3. Sources of indices.

#### Parts discussed today:
1. (World Cartogram): energy consumption > (Continent thematic map) : energy type
2. (Country) : energy type
-- Non-renewable resource
---- Nuclear
-- Renewable resource
---- Solar
---- Wind
---- Hydro
Compare the proportion of each type in total energy production and consumption > piechart
3. (optional) timeline

#### Tasks:
- Data collection and organization -> I-Hui Huang(@ihuihuan)
- Cartograph -> Yi Chen(@chen310)
- Piechart -> Ching-Ju Hsieh(@chingju)
