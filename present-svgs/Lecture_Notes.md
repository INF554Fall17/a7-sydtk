### **Presentation Notes**



1.

Topics: Energy and Human Life

SYDTK: Something You Don'T Know

Group Member: I-Hui Huang, Ching-Ju Hsieh, Yi Chen

Figure out how energy consumption affect human's life



2.

In the project, we will not only show energy data, but will also compare & analyze them with several social indicators. That includes the field of health, economics, environment, education which can reflect the quality of life.



3.

We will present our visualzation to policy makers, members of NGOs, and anyone who is interested in the topic, i.e. how the energy changes people's daily life.



4.

We hope our visualization could give policy makers or NGO members enough information and guide, So that they could know which actions they should do, or which decision they should make to make a balance between energy utilization and human living. 



5.

Our visualization will both analyze the temporal and spatial relations on different scales. Either in world, continent or singal country -- with friendly user experience. That'll facilitate users to locate their interested issues.



6.

We will select some social indicators (such as GDP, life expectancy, etc,) as the representatives of living quality and compare them with energy (newable, nonnewable), to show how significantly they are interacted.



7.

The data sources come from:

Energy Data: BP (one of the world's leading integrated oil and gas companies)  Statistical Review of World Energy June 2017

Social Indicators: UN open data and UNDP (UN Development Programs)



8.

We have two parts of visualizations:

(1) Choropleth maps to show spatial distribution of a certain feature

(2) Various kinds of charts to show multiple features in a certain region

and Interactions : 

(1) between charts and map 

(2) through different scales of map 

(3) through different values of data (data filtering) 



9.

We will consider providing friendly UI, intuitive color and layout chosen to let users focus on core information,  and follow the critique rules from Cairo to review our visualization.



10.

You can see dynamically changed color themes in the choropleth map, based on different features.

Also there are animations during the interaction between map and charts.



11.

There is a website showing energy utility of different countries with map and charts. We also considers the  social indicators. We are more focused on finding the hidden relations between them, just like our group name says: we will discover uncover Something You Don't Know.



12.

We will use ArcGIS Online to publish map service (spatial data source), use leaflet as the interactive map framework, D3.js to build interactive charts, Angular and Bootstrap to generate UI.



13.

Throughout our work, there are three parts, they are also interactive:

Design: Make blueprints for visualization and improve the ideas through several online/offline meetings

Build: Gradually implement components in our blueprints

Evaluate: test every components to see if it works and invite people to use it and give out feedback



14.

As for the job we should content, that includes data preprocessing/cleaning, Webpage design and development, and charts/map design & development. We will equally assign the task and make minor adjust as project carries on.



15.

We will strictly follow the criteria of the syllabus. There are several milestones:

(1) By the end of Week 1. Finish a prototype website

(2) By the end of Week 3. Finish the paper

(2) By the end of Week 4. Deploy the final website
